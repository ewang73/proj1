1. This code uses the scikit framework for Python 3.5.
Packages involved for files labelled "hw1" include
sckikit,
numpy,
pandas,
scipy,
matplotlib,
pyplot,
and
dependencies that require installation before the code is run.

2. The datasets included all come from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/data
The different copies correspond to different versions, generated by SFCrime_convert.

3. The files are labeled by what dataset they correspond to. Crime data is split into 5 files corresponding to each algorithm. Iris data is all in one script.
